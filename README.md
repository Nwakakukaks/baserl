# BaseRL

BaseRL is a Web3 plugin and link generator for enabling Base blockchain interactions anywhere on the web. BaseRL draws inspiration from solana actions and frames on farcaster, bringing to the Base ecosystem the ability to run Base dapps on any web environment

## üåü Features

- **Universal Web3 Integration**: Embed Base blockchain actions in any web2 environment
- **Browser Extension**: Render dynamic HTML context windows for Base interactions
- **IPFS-Powered**: Store and retrieve interaction components via IPFS
- **Custom Generator**: Create preset or custom Base interaction blinks
- **Seamless Blockchain Interaction**: Integrate Base transactions into favorite apps

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Create Components**:

   - Build custom HTML and JavaScript components for Base interactions
   - Use our blink generator for easy component creation

2. **IPFS Storage**:

   - Post components to IPFS for decentralized, censorship-resistant storage

3. **Browser Extension**:

   - Automatically renders IPFS-stored components
   - Interprets special blinks and displays context windows

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with rendered components
   - Sign Base transactions directly within the context window

## üöÄ Use Cases

- **shopping & Ecommerce**: Launch an online global store within minutes
- **Payment**: Recieve payment from clients across the globe on Base
- **Donate**: Launch a decentralized fundraiser on base and share on any platform
- **Governance**: Participate in DAO voting on Base
- **Portfolio**: Showcase you work as a creative. As simple as sharing a link
